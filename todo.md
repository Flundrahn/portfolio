  - ALTERNATIVE convert menubutton animation to jsx
  - NOTE "The SVG <g> element is used to group SVG shapes together. Once grouped you can transform the whole group of shapes as if it was a single shape. This is an advantage compared to a nested <svg> element which cannot be the target of transformation by itself."
