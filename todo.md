# ToDo

- See if can optimize gifs

## Want-to-do

- Check size of icons
- Add cache policy
- Code splitting
- Use startTransition, what is it??
- see if it is possible to keep ItemCircle unmounted, so save time on initial render of app
- Convert hover effects to mobile version, (rather a blink on touch)
- make drawer adapt to screen sizes
- fix animated background white bar problem

## Done

- IDEA, call API to load readme when user hovers on a project, that way load it ahead of click but also just in time, not delaying app initial render time. There is a (coming??) feature called offscreen that allows to pre-render a component.
- convert all setState to have function as argument, if access current state, since calls are async according to documentation.
- change profile image to webp, save time of initial render
- Add nice text on end of timeline
- Revise profile text
- Deploy salsa
- make drawer draggable
- Add alt text to project images
- implement progressive image loading to avoid layout shift
